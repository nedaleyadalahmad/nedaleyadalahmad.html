Python
Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that can be used in many different areas. Python is one of the most famous high-level programming languages, widely used in data analysis, web application development, machine learning.

Thanks to the simple and readable language structure, learning Python is ideal for beginners in the field of programming. They can be used to create programs and applications that have an intuitive user interface, implement scientific computing and statistical analysis, improve the performance of sites and web applications. Python is also useful in building machine learning models and training them on big data, making it an ideal language for the fields of artificial intelligence and data science.
In addition, Python provides many useful libraries and tools for developers to simplify the programming process and speed up development. An integrated development device (IDE) such as PyCharm, popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and the Django software framework are some examples of tools and techniques used in developing programs using the Python language.
